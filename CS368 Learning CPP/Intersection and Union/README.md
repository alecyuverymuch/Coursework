# a1.cpp
In this program, it first reads in 2 input files consisting of an unknown number of student names and outputs the following:  
1. A sorted list of students who are present in both the files (i.e. intersection of the 2 sets of students)  
2. A sorted list of students who are present in at least one of the 2 files (i.e. union of the 2 sets of students).  

### Input files: 
cs302.txt  
cs354.txt  
cs368.txt  
cs402.txt  
dummy.txt  
summa.txt  
> dummy.txt and summa.txt are blank files used for test cases

### Output files:
The intersection of the two lists will be output in a file called  
intersection.txt  
The union of the two lists will be output in a file called  
union.txt

### Compile and Run
Compile and run with Linux g++  
`g++ a1.cpp`  
`./a.out`
