# Matrix
### Desciprtion
A Matrix class capable of storing any type and supports the operators =, +, -, *, +=, -=, *=, ==, !=, and <<.  
The operations supported by this Matrix class:  
1. Addition of 2 matrices using the + operator (e.g. result = m + n)  
2. Subtraction of 2 matrices using the - operator (e.g. result = m - n)  
3. Multiplication of 2 matrices using the * operator (e.g. result = m * n)  
4. Multiplication of a scalar with a matrix (e.g. result = m * 2)  
5. Compound Assignment of 2 matrices (+=, -=, *=)  
6. Multiplication Assignment of a scalar and a matrix (e.g. m *= 2)  
7. Array subscripting operator [], access the elements in the matrix using the following syntax:  
   `m[1][2] = 7;`  
8. Left Shift Operator <<, print a matrix using the following syntax:  
   `std::cout << m << std::endl;`
